Hey there, I'm Ian!

Welcome to my GitHub playground. Here's where I code, create, and occasionally crack a joke or two. 🚀

About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a passionate software engineering student, constantly learning and exploring new technologies.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of web development and honing my skills in JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

💡 I believe in the power of open source and enjoy collaborating with others to build cool projects.

Fun Fact
Why did the developer go broke?

Because he used up all his cache! 😄
